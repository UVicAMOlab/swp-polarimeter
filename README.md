## Spinning waveplate polarimeter

# Real-time detection for polarization of a light source.

(Short introdctory paragraph)
- Using a rotating quarter-waveplate, a photodiode, and a few Python scripts, we are able to determine if incident light is polarized linearly, elliptically, or circularly.
- With minimal cost and technical knowledge this apparatus can be assembled easily.

(Longer more technical paragraph)
- Stokes Vectors
- Indicate to analysis document.
