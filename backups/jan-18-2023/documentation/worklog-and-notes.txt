- Connected Raspberry pi to internet
        - Clock error, refused to load webpages. Solved with

- Created abbreviation-legend.vim to help keep track of abbrvations and definitons of objects. Also running list of terms that are unknown.

NOTES:
        - Does the precision that is seen displayed as 'mean signal' carry through to any math? It is likely that this could cause the mentioned 'unknown uncertainty' if this precision is being used else where. 
		- Though DOP (degree of polarization only has three decimal places)

	- Mean signal appears to display values even when there is little to no light hitting the sensor-more indication of floating point precision errors?
